			<p > 
			This website uses only html and css. The source
			code is available on <a
				href="https://github.com/AmirSahrani/website_source">
				github</a>. This is inspired by <a
				href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">this
				website</a>.

			Although I do care about the loading speed, and realize
			that Javascript is often used for some less than
			ethical ends, I would be lying if I didn't also mention
			that practicality is the foremost reason of the website
			being the way it is. Plain CSS is plenty for a website
			like this, and this allows me to write posts in simple
			HTML, or even markdown. This all without bothering with
			GitHub actions or frameworks such as HUGO that generate
			many auxiliary files, and require specific file/folder
			structures to make a decent website. A side effect of
			this is that I have a much better understanding of why
			things on this website look the way they do, though at
			the cost of the website possibly looking worse than it
			otherwise would have, I am not a front end developer
			after all.

			<br>
			<br>

			The <a href="./gallery.html">gallery</a> for example is
			made using a slightly modified version of <a
				href="https://kulmajaba.com/posts/pure-html-gallery/">this
				gallery</a> using a python script to replace
			the HUGO functionally of automatically filling in image
			meta data such as the width and height. 
			<br> <br>

			This approach has one major drawback, given that I plan
			on writing technical blog posts, rendering math will
			likely be an issue. For this I might break my rule and
			allow JavaScript into my live. As far as I can tell
			this is not an issue for proper syntax highlighting, as
			this can be done by embedding the lexical information
			in the HTML using website such as <a
				href="https://highlight.hohli.com/">this</a>.

			<br><br>

			That being said, I would like for the web to be a bit
			more like this website, and a bit less like 
			websites asking about your cookie preferences 
			while talking about not needing your consent.
