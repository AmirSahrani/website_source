	<h1 class="title" >About</h1>

			<p > 
			This website uses only html and css. The source
			code is available on <a
				href="https://github.com/AmirSahrani/website_source">
				github</a>. This is inspired by <a
				href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">this
				website</a>.

			Although I do care about the loading speed, security
			and privacy of this, I would be lying if I didn't also
			mention that practicality the foremost reason of the
			website being the way it is. Plain CSS is plenty for a
			website like this, and this allows me to write posts in
			simple HTML, or even markdown if I want to without
			bothering with github actions or frameworks that
			generate 100 auxiliary files to make a decent website.

			<br>
			<br>

			The <a href="./gallery.html">gallery</a> for example is
			made using a slightly modified version of <a
				href="https://kulmajaba.com/posts/pure-html-gallery/">this
				gallery</a> using a python script to replace
			the HUGO functionally of automatically filling in image
			meta data such as the width and height. 
			<br> <br>

			That being said, I would like for the web to be a bit
			more like this website, and a bit less like 
			websites asking about your cookie preferences 
			while talking about not needing your consent.
