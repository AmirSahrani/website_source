	<h1 class="title" >Learning NixOS</h1>

	<p>
	Having used Linux for about 4 years now. I started with Arch, and
	quickly realized that was a bad decision, and retreated to Fedora.
	Fedora worked fine until I wanted to do anything with CUDA, for some
	reason I could not get this to work consistently, and out of
	frustration switched to Pop OS. Pop OS was the first time I felt
	comfortable installing and updating, feeling like most essential
	software would not break.



	<p>
	Pop OS was working well, until I got a new desktop. Now every time I
	installed a new package or program, there would be a difference between
	my laptop and desktop. Furthermore, as I started to branch out of
	simple python development and integrate multiple languages I noticed 
	programs would fail to run on other machines. This later issue might
	be fixed by using something like Docker, but in my never ending yearning
	to change my computing environments I wanted something more. I wanted to 
	know about every program installed on my computer. I wanted to run NixOS
	</p>

	Now
