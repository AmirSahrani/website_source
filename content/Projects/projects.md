## [Mechanistic Interpretability of Transformers](../Sorting_Transformers.pdf)

I investigate a transformer trained on the task of sorting. With the use of the local learning coefficient, the complexity of the model was estimated. The model was found to perform most computation in the first layer, after which the subsequence layers 'refined the input'  </p>
