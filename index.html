		Hello! I am a computational researcher, I have a master's in
		computational science and a bachelor's in psychology. I am
		interested in AI-safety, Game Theory and Computer science.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am also a nerd in general. I use Linux, annoy people around
		me by telling them to use Linux, and I like coffee. I am also
		convinced that being a nerd is a prerequisite to liking
		coffee, as normal people do not and should not care this much about a hot
		beverage. Apart from these oddities, I also enjoy 
		photography, film, and bouldering.

		Please take a look around! My Blog is still a work in progress,
		but soon there should be a post on switching to NixOS... If I ever
		figure out how to turn my configuration into a new image.
