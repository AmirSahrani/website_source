		We examine whether deliberation can improve democratic
		decision-making by helping voters develop more structured,
		coherent preferences. We adapted mathematical models to study
		how people update their political opinions through discussion,
		focusing on whether groups can reach shared understanding of
		policy issues. Which is how we define “meta-agreement”.

		I investigate a transformer trained on the task of sorting.
		With the use of the local learning coefficient, the complexity
		of the model was estimated. The model was found to perform most
		computation in the first layer, after which the subsequence
		layers ‘refined the input’
