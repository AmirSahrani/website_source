			We examine whether deliberation can improve democratic
			decision-making by helping voters develop more
			structured, coherent preferences. We adapted
			mathematical models to study how people update their
			political opinions through discussion, focusing on
			whether groups can reach shared understanding of policy
			issues — which is how we define “meta-agreement”.

			We investigate a transformer trained on the task of
			sorting. With the use of the local learning
			coefficient, the complexity of the model was estimated.
			The model was found to perform most computation in the
			first layer, after which the subsequence layers
			‘refined the output’ without changing patterns shown in
			the first layer.
