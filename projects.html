			We examine whether deliberation can improve democratic
			decision-making by helping voters develop more
			structured, coherent preferences. We adapted
			mathematical models to study how people update their
			political opinions through discussion, focusing on
			whether groups can reach shared understanding of policy
			issues — which is how we define “meta-agreement”.

			We investigate a transformer trained on the task of
			sorting. With the use of the local learning
			coefficient, the complexity of the model was estimated.
			The model was found to perform most computation in the
			first layer, after which the subsequence layers
			‘refined the output’ without changing patterns shown in
			the first layer.

			The repo containing my Advent of Code (AoC) solutions. I
			have participated since 2022 (I think), but only
			started tracking my code on GitHub since 2024. That was
			also the year I decided to use AoC to learn a new
			language. This proved to be rather successful as I
			ended up writing my master thesis in OCaml, while
			having had very little experience with functional
			programming. This year (2025) I am using it to learn
			Rust, and so far I really enjoy the tooling, and
			especially the compiler. The general syntax and
			ergonomics of the language are also a big improvement
			over OCaml in my opinion.
